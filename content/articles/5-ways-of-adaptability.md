Adaptability is one of the most important skills we can develop today. It shapes how we respond to change, navigate uncertainty, and continue growing in fast-shifting environments.<br><br>

Joining [Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=mobile-development) was an exciting journey for me. I had to adapt to a new environment, new people, and a new way of working. Here are the 5 ways I adapted:

## 1. Interacting

Adaptability starts with the way we communicate and connect with others.

Being adaptable means knowing how to adjust:<br><br>

- your tone,  
- your approach,  
- your expectations,  
- and your communication style, depending on the person and situation.<br><br>

Good adaptability makes collaboration smoother and prevents unnecessary conflict.

## 2. Achieving

Goals can change. Targets shift. Plans evolve.

Adaptable people don’t break when expectations move — they **adjust**.<br><br>

They:<br><br>

- redefine what success looks like,  
- adjust timelines,  
- remain committed despite obstacles,  
- and stay flexible enough to change direction when needed.<br><br>  

This helps them stay consistent even when conditions aren’t ideal.

## 3. Learning

Adaptability thrives on learning — and not just *any* learning.<br><br>

It’s about:<br><br>

- learning new things,  
- **re-learning** what you thought you knew,  
- and **un-learning** old habits that no longer work.<br><br>

Continuous learners adapt faster because they’re open to new perspectives.

## 4. Working

The world of work is changing rapidly — remote work, hybrid setups, automation, new tools.<br><br>

Adaptable people can:<br><br>

- switch between platforms,  
- adjust to new workflows,  
- embrace new responsibilities,  
- and stay productive in different environments.<br><br>

This keeps them relevant and resilient.

## 5. Thinking

Perhaps the most important form of adaptability:<br><br>

**mental adaptability**.<br><br>

This means having a mindset that:<br><br>

- tolerates uncertainty,  
- accepts that change is inevitable,  
- reframes challenges as opportunities,  
- and stays curious instead of threatened by new things.<br><br>

Adaptable thinkers don’t just survive change — they grow through it.

## Closing Thoughts

Adaptability isn’t a skill you master once.  
It’s a lifelong practice — a mindset of flexibility, curiosity, and openness.<br><br>

The more adaptable you become, the more confidently you can navigate the unpredictable world ahead.<br><br>

**Stay flexible. Stay curious. Keep evolving.**
