In today’s fast-moving environment, solving problems isn’t about having the right answers — it's about asking the right questions.

Critical thinking is the foundation of meaningful problem-solving. It helps us:<br><br>

- break down complex issues,  
- spot hidden assumptions,  
- generate better options,  
- and act decisively when uncertainty is high.<br><br>

Choosing Bangkit was a deliberate decision for me, aiming to enhance my professionalism post-graduation. Facing significant hurdles, particularly from within, has tested my resilience and critical thinking at [Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=mobile-development).

## Why Critical Thinking Matters

When you rely purely on intuition or past habits, you limit your possible solutions.  
But when you apply critical thinking, you expand them.<br><br>

- You start asking “Why?” instead of accepting “Because”.  
- You learn to challenge how things have always been done.  
- You open up for better alternatives.

## The Critical Thinking Process

- **Clarify** — Identify exactly what the problem is.  
- **Gather** — Collect relevant data, evidence, and perspectives.  
- **Analyze** — Break down the data, look for patterns, biases, and assumptions.  
- **Evaluate** — Weigh your options, list pros & cons, foresee consequences.  
- **Decide & Act** — Choose a path and move, then reflect on results.

## Problem-Solving in Practice

When you combine critical thinking with problem-solving, you become more than reactive — you become strategic.<br><br>

- Instead of “fixing what’s broken”, you ask “What needs to change and why?”.  
- Instead of “emergency mode”, you work in “purpose mode”.  
- Instead of repeating outcomes, you create new ones.

## Closing Thoughts

Great problem-solvers don’t wait for perfect clarity — they act on clear thinking.  
They recognise that almost every problem is also an opportunity for growth.<br><br>

If you’re ready to level-up your thinking, start today: challenge one assumption, ask one better question, and let the process guide you.<br><br>

**Stay curious. Think critically. Solve smart.**
