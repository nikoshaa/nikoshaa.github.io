## What I learned from Designing for Belajar Bekerja

Collaboration between UI Illustrator, UI/UX Designer, and Product Manager is key to producing a design with a better user experience that aligned with the company’s brand.
Within discussion, a UI Illustrator must clearly communicate about which design styles fit for the company.
Time management is important to achieve the deadline.
