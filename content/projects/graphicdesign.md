**Graphic Design Exploration**

In my free time, I passionately immerse myself in the world of Graphic Design, continuously exploring and refining my skills.

## Shopee Indonesia

I've created over 200 engaging social media posts for Shopee Indonesia's official accounts, like @shopee_id and @shopeemoms_id, to increase engagement and brand awareness. My work involved making high-quality illustrations that match Shopee's style, maintaining a consistent brand look across different social media. I managed multiple projects at once, meeting deadlines and contributing to Shopee Indonesia's success as a top e-commerce platform in the region.

## SIRCLO

I've crafted over 50 dynamic visual pieces, encompassing social media graphics, posters, and diverse materials, in support of SIRCLO's employer branding objectives. My collaboration with the People Operations team involved translating their vision into impactful, on-brand designs that resonate with candidates and employees. I ensured alignment with SIRCLO's brand guidelines, preserving a uniform and distinctive visual identity across our employer branding initiatives.

## Plus Jakarta

As a volunteer in the Plus Jakarta city branding project under the Governor's Delivery Unit (GDU), I effectively served as a graphic designer, producing Instagram posts and merchandise masks. These creations played a pivotal role in highlighting the synergy between Jakarta's provincial administration and its community, capturing the core of the city's identity and ambitions.
