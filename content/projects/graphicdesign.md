In my free time, I passionately immerse myself in the world of Graphic Design, continuously exploring and refining my skills.

## Sports Station – Promotional Campaign Design

I designed a bold and high-impact promotional key visual for @sportsstation.id to announce the opening of their new store at @agora.lifestylemall. The concept emphasizes urgency and strong retail energy—aligned with Sports Station’s brand identity and campaign tone.<br><br>

The visual highlights a “Special Deal – Up to 70% OFF” message using striking typography, red textured backgrounds, and expressive hand-drawn elements to capture attention instantly. The layout ensures clear hierarchy, with the promotional message being the focal point while retaining brand consistency and readability across digital placements.<br><br>

This design was optimized for use across multiple formats, including social media posts, story banners, in-store screens, and promotional materials—ensuring maximum visibility during the opening period and driving customer interest to the new location.<br><br>

I designed a modern and functional 2025 corporate calendar for PT Lintang Utama Infotek, combining a clean layout with a strong visual identity that reflects the company’s brand as an IT Total Solutions provider. The calendar features a structured grid system, balanced typography, and custom graphical elements inspired by modern data patterns—creating a professional look that aligns with the company’s technological focus.<br><br>

The design incorporates LUI’s signature color palette and geometric accents to give each month a distinct yet cohesive appearance. Important national holidays and collective leave days are highlighted for quick reference, enhancing usability for employees and clients.<br><br>

With a blend of clarity, corporate aesthetics, and subtle branding, this calendar was optimized for both digital sharing and high-quality print production, serving as a practical and visually appealing asset for internal use and corporate distribution.<br><br>

I designed a modern and professional ID Card set for PT Lintang Utama Infotek, reflecting the company’s identity as a leading IT Total Solutions provider. The visual approach uses a clean blue gradient combined with subtle technology-inspired waveform elements to reinforce the corporate and tech-driven impression.<br><br>

The front layout emphasizes clarity and branding, featuring the LUI logo and corporate tagline. The back side includes essential employee information, a secure QR code for verification or access control, and the company’s head office details—making it practical for both daily operations and internal security protocols.<br><br>

The overall design maintains strong consistency with LUI’s branding system, ensuring the ID cards look premium, reliable, and aligned with modern corporate standards. This ID card set is optimized for high-quality printing, making it suitable for long-term professional use across all departments.<br><br>

I created a modern and engaging hiring campaign visual for PT Lintang Utama Infotek to support their recruitment needs across multiple positions, including Technical Engineer, Accounting, Account Manager, and Software Engineer.<br><br>

The design uses a bright, dynamic, and professional illustration style to reflect LUI’s identity as an innovative IT solutions company. Attractive gradients, smooth shapes, and motion-inspired elements were incorporated to symbolize growth, opportunity, and forward momentum—key themes aligned with recruitment messaging.<br><br>

Clear visual hierarchy ensures that important information such as job positions, qualifications, and head office details is easy to read and visually appealing. The overall layout is optimized for use across digital platforms including Instagram, LinkedIn, WhatsApp Broadcast, and internal announcements.<br><br>
