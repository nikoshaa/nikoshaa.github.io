      <strong class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">The Story Behind ‘Maxtansy’</strong><br><br>

      Born with the real name <strong class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Wildan Hafidz Mauludin</strong>,
      I wanted an identity that truly reflects who I am. Over time, the name
      <strong>“Maxtansy”</strong> became my personal signature — a blend of
      <em>creativity</em>, <em>character</em>, and the way I approach building things that matter.
    </p>

    <!-- The Real Me -->
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-10">
      <strong class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">The Real Me</strong><br><br>

      I’m someone who loves building, learning, and exploring how things work beneath the surface.
      Although most people know me as <strong>Maxtansy</strong>, I was born with the name
      <strong>Wildan Hafidz Mauludin</strong> — a name that feels formal, while “Maxtansy” represents the
      creative, curious, and technical side of me.<br><br>

      My journey into technology didn’t begin with a perfect roadmap. It started with curiosity —
      breaking things, fixing them again, experimenting with software, and slowly realizing that
      I enjoy <em>creating more than consuming</em>.<br><br>

      Over the years, I’ve explored design, backend development, databases, and automation, but
      building digital experiences has always been the space where I feel most
      <strong>alive</strong>.<br><br>

      I enjoy working independently, solving problems logically, and turning ideas into something real —
      something that lives, moves, and helps people. I don’t limit myself to one role; I enjoy
      being flexible. Whether it's designing an interface, writing code, optimizing logic, or
      managing data, I like to understand the whole system — <em>end to end</em>.<br><br>

      Most importantly, I’m always learning. I don’t believe in staying still.
      Every day is a chance to understand something new, build something better, and become someone
      wiser than yesterday.
    </p>

    <!-- What I Believe In -->
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-10">
      <strong class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">What I Believe In</strong><br><br>

      I believe in building things that last — whether it’s work, trust, relationships, or habits.
      I don’t chase perfection; I chase <strong>progress</strong>, even if it’s slow, quiet, or unseen by others.<br><br>

      I believe in being <strong>useful</strong>.
      Not just productive, not just busy — but helpful, meaningful, and intentional.<br><br>

      I believe that <strong>consistency beats talent</strong>, that kindness outlives intelligence,
      and that the biggest breakthroughs often come from the simplest decisions we make daily.<br><br>

      I believe that every person is shaped by their past, but not defined by it.
      You don’t have to know the entire road ahead — you just need to keep moving.<br><br>

      As Steve Jobs once said:<br><br>

      <em class="block text-gray-800 dark:text-white text-xl font-medium">
        “You can’t connect the dots looking forward;
        you can only connect them looking backward.”
      </em><br>

      I believe in integrity when no one is watching, in building quietly, in improving steadily,
      and in doing good even when it seems small.<br><br>

      Because at the end of the day, what you contribute to the world — no matter how simple —
      is what truly remains.
